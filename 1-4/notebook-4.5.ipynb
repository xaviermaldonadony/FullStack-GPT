      "Ingredients:\n",
      "- 1 cup of rice\n",
      "- 1 cup of water\n",
      "- 1 tablespoon of yeast\n",
      "- 1 tablespoon of sugar\n",
      "\n",
      "Instructions:\n",
      "1. Rinse the rice thoroughly and soak it in water for at least 1 hour.\n",
      "2. Drain the rice and place it in a steamer basket. Steam the rice for about 30 minutes, or until it is cooked through.\n",
      "3. Allow the rice to cool to room temperature.\n",
      "4. In a large bowl, mix the yeast and sugar with the water until dissolved.\n",
      "5. Add the cooled rice to the yeast mixture and mix well.\n",
      "6. Cover the bowl with a clean cloth and let it sit at room temperature for 3-4 days, stirring occasionally.\n",
      "7. After 3-4 days, strain the mixture through a cheesecloth or fine mesh strainer to remove any solids.\n",
      "8. Transfer the liquid to a clean glass jar or bottle and store it in the refrigerator.\n",
      "9. Serve the soju chilled and enjoy responsibly. Ingredients:\n",
      "- 3 1/2 cups all-purpose flour\n",
      "- 1 packet active dry yeast\n",
      "- 1 1/2 cups warm water\n",
      "- 1 tablespoon sugar\n",
      "- 1 teaspoon salt\n",
      "- 2 tablespoons olive oil\n",
      "\n",
      "Instructions:\n",
      "1. In a small bowl, dissolve the yeast and sugar in warm water. Let it sit for about 10 minutes until it becomes frothy.\n",
      "2. In a large mixing bowl, combine the flour and salt. Make a well in the center and pour in the yeast mixture and olive oil.\n",
      "3. Mix everything together until a dough forms. Knead the dough on a floured surface for about 10 minutes until it becomes smooth and elastic.\n",
      "4. Place the dough in a greased bowl, cover with a clean towel, and let it rise in a warm place for about 1 hour or until it doubles in size.\n",
      "5. Punch down the dough and shape it into a loaf. Place it in a greased loaf pan, cover, and let it rise for another 30 minutes.\n",
      "6. Preheat the oven to 375°F (190°C). Bake the bread for about 30-35 minutes or until it is golden brown and sounds hollow when tapped on the bottom.\n",
      "7. Remove the bread from the oven and let it cool on a wire rack before slicing and serving. Enjoy your freshly baked bread! \n",
